# DYNAMIC-ABAP
ABAP code to implement a fully dynamic information system on Netweaver 

An information system does 3 things: 
- Enable the user to capture information as well as the rules that govern the information
- Share information in a controlled manner
- Analyse information to extract derived information

Ultimately, every individual will have his/her own interconnected blob(s) of information and share pieces of it with others. They will be able to attach new information to their own blobs or to the blobs shared by others
